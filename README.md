# Crookview

This was a project developed for the Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul (UFMS) during the subject of Web Programming.
It was a group project, the 4 members were divided between frontend and backend:

**Frontend**
- [Breno](https://github.com/Breno7K)
- [Pedro](https://github.com/Pslittee01)

**Backend**
- [Murilo](https://github.com/MuriloMatias)
- [Lütz](https://github.com/lutzzdias)

## Summary of the story of this repo

The stack the [professor](https://github.com/hsborges) encouraged us to use was Java WEB and no framework for the frontend. However, because JavaScript is the most used language for web development, there was some difficulty configuring Java in the computer of the team members and Java WEB is not very popular, we spoke to the professor and he allowed us to develop this project using any stack we liked.

In the end, we decided to use nodeJS for the backend, the frontend was chosen (in the last moments) to be EJS. 
We opted for a SQL database in order to practice more traditional database structuring and handling, settling on using PostgreSQL.

After showing the project to the professor, he said the backend was approved. Everything was working, it was well structured and correct. The UI part of the frontend was ok as well, but there was no integration. This happened because the frontend was developed on the last moments before the deadline. Because of that lack of integration we did not get a good grade, but the teacher gave us an opportunity to improve the app and present it to him again. This improvement was to be done individually.

After that, [Lütz](https://github.com/lutzzdias) and [Murilo](https://github.com/MuriloMatias) decided that they would improve the app and their grade. Murilo refactored what was necessary in the backend to integrate with the frontend developed by Lütz. At this moment, the frontend was remade from scratch, using next and react.

Despite being pretty stressfull and still not resulting in a complete application after the refactoring, this website made us all grow as developers. We learned how to work as a team, new technologies, backend and frontend related problems and challenges (especially dealing with images).
